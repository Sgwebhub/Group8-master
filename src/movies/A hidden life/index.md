description: "A Hidden Life is a 2019 epic historical drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick. It stars August Diehl, Valerie Pachner, and Matthias Schoenaerts with both Michael Nyqvist and Bruno Ganz in their final performances. The film depicts the life of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian farmer and devout Catholic who refused to fight for the Nazis in World War II. The title is taken from George Eliot's Middlemarch, which in turn derives it from a phrase in the New Testament, the Epistle to the Colossians 3:3: "For you died, and [now] your life is hidden with Christ in God.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5827916/"

As seen in A Hidden Life, other people's attempts to convince Franz that he had a responsibility to his family saw no budge in his convictions. While he maintained the ideology that he was only responsible for his own actions, and did not pass judgement onto others (a beautiful conversation between Diehl's character and a Nazi court official alludes to this state of mind), Jägerstätter faced a military trial where he was accused of Wehrkraftzersetzung – undermining of troop morale – and found guilty of sedition. He was sentenced to death.
