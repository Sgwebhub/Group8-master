‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’, which touches the hearts of viewers, motivates and inspires to follow our goals in life, also has a lot to offer from the perspective of financial planning. Let’s have a discussion on “5 financial planning lessons from the movie Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.”

(1) Set goals at various stages of life then run (follow) to achieve them

In the Farhan Akhtar-starrer, Milkha Singh is seen running in different stages of his life for a variety of goals. Let’s take a look at
these:

A young Milkha runs in hot sands from school to reach home early. Later, he’s seen running from people who attack his family, and from other kids after beating his brother-in-law.

Runs atop a train after stealing coal

During his training in the Indian Army, Milkha runs in the cross-country race to earn a mug full of milk, 2 eggs and relief from exercise each day

Similarly, we need to set financial goals in different stages of life, adapt to situations that come our way (cash flow) and follow a financial plan with dedication to achieve them.

(2) Nothing is impossible to the mind that believes

In movie, Milkha singhs coach challenges him to defeat the current champion. Milkha singh accepted the challenge with confidence and faith.


 
Similarly while financial planning one should be strong from his/ her mind and follow what he/ she believes. Dont get influenced from the fellow financial planners and get adapted to their style of financial planning. Create niche for yourself in the market.

(3) Earn things you really need and dont eye others things with greed

Milkha Singh, as seen in the film, is astonished to see a blazer worn by champion runner Sher Singh Rana. One day, when Milkha picks up and wears the blazer, just to get a feel of it, he’s attacked and insulted. Coach Gurudev Singh slaps Milkha, explaining that it is not easy to get things you like and that you need to work hard to earn them.
