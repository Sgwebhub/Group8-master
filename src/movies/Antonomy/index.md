- Exemplary leadership

- Timely communications

- Supreme teamwork

- Absolute adaptability

- Preparing for the unpredictable

The Apollo 13 crew spent over 400 hours in simulators and flight controllers participated in numerous pre-mission simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight. NASA’s rigorous preparation, rehearsal, testing and existing procedures proved to be highly adaptable when faced with the new set of issues raised from the Apollo 13 accident.

Yet, most often a crisis is unpredictable. In the eye of a new storm, there may be no precedent for specific action required, as was also the case for Apollo 13. Where there was no precise contingency in place, teams, equipped with their pre-mission preparation, applied past learnings to new improvisation techniques and with the same meticulous obsession and attention to detail they used for everything else: the aim was to reduce risk. This process led to faster, more reliable outcomes.
Whilst every eventuality cannot be planned for with exact precision, most crisis situations benefit from a predetermined, planned and well-rehearsed course of action should an issue arise. Preparation is key.

Failure was ‘not an option’

50 years later we remember Apollo 13’s triumph over tragedy. The solutions to save the space mission that came so close to disaster has repeatedly been referred to as NASA’s finest hour and the response to the emergency by the steel-willed team, as outstanding. It is a shining example of NASA’s innovative minds working together to save lives.

A little-known fact: whilst the mission failed to reach the Moon it succeeded in setting a world record for reaching the highest altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft at 400,171 km from Earth.
