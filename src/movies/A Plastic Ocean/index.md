In the center of the Pacific Ocean gyre our researchers found more plastic than plankton. A Plastic Ocean
documents the newest science, proving how plastics, once they enter the oceans, break up into small
particulates that enter the food chain where they attract toxins like a magnet. These toxins are stored in
seafoodâ€™s fatty tissues, and are eventually consumed by us.
If it was happening in one gyre, they suspected it was happening in all of them. But the filmmakers needed
experts to prove it
