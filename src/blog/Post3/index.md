## 5. 'Malcolm X'(1992).
 No one but Spike Lee could have made this epic, which follows not just the Black Muslim firebrand's biography but also the history of urban African-American life in the tumultuous middle years of the 20th century. Denzel Washington gives one of his most impassioned performances as he portrays Malcolm X's evolution from zoot-suited street thug to convict to civil rights leader to spiritual pilgrim.
## 4. 'My Left Foot' (1989).
 Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his thorough immersion into the cerebral palsy-wracked body of Christy Brown, the Irish author and artist who learned to write and paint with the title appendage, the one limb he could control. Day-Lewis deserves credit for bringing Brown to raucous, profane, unsentimental life, but so does Hugh O'Conor, who plays the boy Christie with equally fierce determination.
## 3. 'Schindler's List' (1993).
 In the world of near-universal evil, how do you explain the shock of goodness like that of Oskar Schindler, the industrialist who risked his business, his fortune, and his life to save more than a thousand Polish Jews from the Holocaust? Wisely, Liam Neeson doesn't even try to explain it, delivering instead a tricky, close-to-the-vest performance as a con man confident enough to think he could cheat the Devil. Director Steven Spielberg brings all of his formidable gifts to bear on this story, giving it a feverish moral and dramatic intensity he's seldom approached before or since.
## 2. 'Raging Bull' (1980).
 If Jake LaMotta hadn't existed, Martin Scorsese might have had to invent him. As portrayed in this film, the Italian-American boxer is a human volcano, erupting with violence, machismo, sexual hangups, guilt, and possible redemption. An archetypal Scorsese anti-hero, he's played with total commitment by Robert De Niro, who popularized here the Method technique of ruining his body, packing on 60 pounds to play the older, heavier LaMotta. Working in silvery black and white and choreographing the boxing matches so that they play like sex scenes, Scorsese and De Niro create a character study that's horrifying, fascinating, and utterly compelling.
## 1. 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962).
 The real T.E. Lawrence was an inscrutable figure, looming like a desert mirage and enshrouded by his own self-mythologizing, but David Lean's sand-swept masterpiece immerses you in its widescreen vistas and makes you feel like you're riding alongside him, charging across the dunes and fighting the Turks.
